# Arkansas eSchool Extension for Chrome
#### A simple companion extension for the eSchool Student Management System used in Arkansas K12 schools.  It provides direct access to eSchool, Cognos, Triand, and other state resources right from the toolbar, while automatically configuring several recommended Chrome browser settings.

It's available for download from the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ark12-eschool/odkbbhpbbblonhejlfchddeenjhdplka)  

*This project was originally written to handle mixed-content errors that were in the state's specific installation.  Those problems were fixed some time ago, but I received numerous requests to keep the extension available for those that wanted to continue using it as a "shortcut" and for it's ability to automatically set the suggested browser settings.  It no longer serves any significant purpose.*
